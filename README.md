# Automated Backup System (Bash Script)

## Overview
This project provides a **fully automated backup system** written in **Bash**.  
It creates timestamped, compressed `.tar.gz` backups of your files, verifies integrity with SHA256 checksums, rotates old backups using a 7-4-3 policy (daily-weekly-monthly), and can restore files when needed.
